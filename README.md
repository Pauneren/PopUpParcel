# PopUpParcel

I created a reusable pop up dialogue with Parcel bundler.
The Html is simple and serves only the purpose of demonstrating the functionality of the pop up dialogue.
I used Node js to create json files.
The index.js contains a class function which has a method : showPopUp which takes parameters of headerText and bodyText.
